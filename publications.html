While doing my bachelor's degree, I learned basic French and found it so interesting that I decided to pursue a PhD in a French-speaking country. I was the guy traveling one and a half hours from my hometown to the nearest city to improve my French. From 2018 to 2024, I pursued my PhD at the University of Montreal. During those six years, I deeply explored the revegetation of bare soils with herbaceous species and their role in tree succession. During my PhD, I also delved into the fascinating world of data in the Living Data Project. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow beginning a new scientific adventure at TÉLUQ University, where I will be working on biological stressors affecting the forest cover health of SÉPAQ parks in southern Quebec. I will also be researching greenhouse gases in agroforestry ecosystems.
