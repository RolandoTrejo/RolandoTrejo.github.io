<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
  
I have been in touch with nature since I was a child. My first years of life were spent in a small town in Mexico, where my parents taught me how to work with animals and plants. I learned to milk cows at the age of ten. I consider myself very lucky because I was able to continue studying after finishing secondary education in my hometown. I have always been very close to science, as I attended a high school focused on agriculture and then pursued a bachelor's degree in forest restoration.

I have also been very curious, and my curiosity has taken me to many countries to pursue my studies. For instance, I participated in an exchange program at the Universitat de Lleida in Spain, and yes, I can understand the Catalan language. I also did an internship at the Universidad Nacional, where I explored the applications of geographic information systems (GIS) applied to landslides. To explore new scientific tools, I completed a master's degree in water sciences, where I investigated the ecology of Prosopis and Pseudomonas in a greenhouse experiment.

While doing my bachelor's degree, I learned basic French and found it so interesting that I decided to pursue a PhD in a French-speaking country. I was the guy traveling one and a half hours from my hometown to the nearest city to improve my French. From 2018 to 2024, I pursued my PhD at the University of Montreal. During those six years, I deeply explored the revegetation of bare soils with herbaceous species and their role in tree succession. During my PhD, I also delved into the fascinating world of data in the Living Data Project. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow beginning a new scientific adventure at TÉLUQ University, where I will be working on biological stressors affecting the forest cover health of SÉPAQ parks in southern Quebec. I will also be researching greenhouse gases in agroforestry ecosystems.

Learning is just beautiful!
